## Team :
### Project title: ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III, How much energy will a building consume?

### Professors:  Pr. Agathe GUILLOUX and Pr. Simon BUSSY

### Students: Mamadou Kanoute , Imad Bouhou , Ibrahima BA

## Project Description :

Computing the value of energy efficiency improvements is difficult because we can't truly know how much energy a building would have used without improvements. 
Therefore, the best solution is to build counterfactual models that predict the buildingâ€™s pre-retrofit energy use rate in the post-retrofit period and to compare the value obtained with the real value in hand to know if the improvement made were efficient in lowering the energy consumption.

## The project's Goal

In this project we'll develop accurate models to predict metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters.
The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe. With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, 
large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies.
